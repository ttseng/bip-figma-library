# bip-figma-library
Figma Component Library for Design Documentation, inspired by [Build in Progress](http://buildinprogress.media.mit.edu/).
For an overview of the motivation for this project, please check out this [blog post](https://medium.com/@scientiffic/a-figma-library-for-design-documentation-db0fc2121479)

![Overview](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*xXM0llLX_7AMYoLFbSHk3w.png)

This Github repo is meant solely for feature requests & issue reporting.  The actual Component Library lives within a [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) Team.  To try out the feature, please send an email to scientiffic (at) gmail.com to have your student account added to the Figma team.

## Documentation Principles
The idea behind this Figma library is to support process-oriented documentation.  It is essentially a flow diagram tool where individual steps correspond with steps you take in a project, and branches represent iterations or categories of efforts.  Some examples of how branches can be used include:

1. Showing different prototypes 
2. The contributions of multiple members within a project
3. Different categories of efforts in an integrated product (for example, hardware, software, design, etc.)

## The Components

The library currently consists of a basic set of components:

### Steps
**Overview** Meant to be used as the root of a project Process Map.  Add a project title, overview image, and description of the project here.
**Step** Individual steps in a project. You can add a title, image, and description, along with the date.

### Connectors
Use connectors to create branches within a project.  Connectors are available with and without ending arrows (the latter of which is located under 'flow arrows')

### Labels
Labels are used to label branches within a Process Map.  You can edit the text and color.

## Using the Figma Component Library  
The team containing the Component Library is created under a student account, so I can only add other students to the project.  To request access, email scientiffic (at) gmail.com with a description of your intended use case and the student / education account you currently have registered with Figma.

Once you are added to the team, follow these steps:
1. Add the Colors & Component Libraries
* Create a new file in the project Example Projects
* Click on the **Assets** tab
* Click on the Library icon
* Ensure that **BiP Colors** & **BiP Components** are toggled on.

2. Adding Components
* Click and drag out any of the components from the Assets tab into your document
* To edit any of the existing fields (i.e., the title, description, image) use cmd + double click to select the individual component and override the default content.
* When adding a connector, you can click on it to reveal the resize handles and click and drag to adjust.  You can also flip horizontal or vertical (shift+H or shift+V) or adjust the angle of rotation
